Virtual-Flashcards
==================

Similar to paper flashcards, this script gives the user the option to quiz him/herself by looking at either 
the term or definition.  The basic natural language technology used in the "guess_if_correct" function 
eliminates stopwords and compares the number of key terms identified in your guess to the correct answer.
